## Types of Functions -:
1. Named : normal
2. Anonymous : A function that does not have a name. It is usually assigned to a variable or used as a callback. Since it has no name, it cannot be called directly.
   ```js
        function greet() {
            return "Hello!";
        }
        console.log(greet()); // Hello!
   ```
